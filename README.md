# A simple CDSW example using a python Face Recognition library.

This project is the solution for Lab 11 in the CDSW workshop.

# Install libraries

In order to get the lab running, install the neccesary python Libraries.
The installation of the libraries require a CDSW environment with 16GB or RAM.

Install the libraries using pip install:

pip install face-recognition
pip install opencv-python

When the libraries are installed, close the workbench and start a new python workbench using 4GB RAM.

# Run the example

Now you can run the program test.py
